# Web-Scraping

web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. All the job is carried out by a piece of code which is called a “scraper”. First, it sends a “GET” query to a specific website. Then, it parses an HTML document based on the received result. After it’s done, the scraper searches for the data you need within the document, and, finally, convert it into the specified format. You can scrape pictures, text information, product items, video, contact information and so on.
